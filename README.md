# The Tidy Idaho Legal Dataset Project

This repo is intended to be a public place to store the state of Idaho's legal data in formats conducive for writing informative reports and building useful tools.

## High-level folders

- `scripts` - contains useful scripts for processing the data, etc.
- `raw_data` - where the raw data is (i.e. PDFs of each statute)
- `derived_data`- where the processed data is (i.e. CSV files of the statutes, etc.)
- `documents` - where reference material can be found (i.e. docs that describe how the statutes are organized, etc.)

## Further Action

TBD
